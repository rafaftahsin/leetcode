### Case 3 

In the statement of the question, It didn't provide further instructions after several cars become a fleet.

10
[0,4,2]
[2,1,3]
```


1st run: 2 5 5 (1st and 2nd became a fleet, I assume the answer should be TWO since there are no further instructions on the question or the example)
However, after a couple of runs:
2nd run: 4,6,8
3rd run: 6,7,11
4th run: 8,8,14 (0th and 1st became a fleet, the answer is ONE)

Based on the result of the test, I assume that the until all cars arrive at or pass the destination, there are some potential cases that any car could join to a fleet. It's better to state or clarify this part.
